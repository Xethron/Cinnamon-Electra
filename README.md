## Motivation

A lot of the 3rd party Cinnamon themes are out of date and does not reflect some of the latest changes the default theme has.

As I do a lot of testing for Cinnamon, I had to ether use the default theme, or create my own that will stay up to date!

The idea behind this theme is to create the best looking dark theme possible for Cinnamon, wile always keeping it up to date with the latest changes on linuxmint/Cinnamon, autarkper/Cinnamon and Xethron/Cinnamon repo's.

## Installation

```bash
mkdir ~/.themes
cd ~/.themes
git clone git@github.com:Xethron/Cinnamon-Electra.git
```

Open up Cinnamon Settings -> Themes -> Select Cinnamon Electra
